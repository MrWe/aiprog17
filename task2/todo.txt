1. Implement constraints
  a. All segments in a row or col must be seperated by one or more white spaces
    i. For a segment A, segment B must be placed at a space > start(A) + len(A)
  b. All segments must be placed within the given boundaries
  c. No segments must create a conflict between a row and a column
    i.  Implement validate_row_state() //TODO: Aggie
    ii. Implement detect_conflict(row, col)
2. Implement preprocessing of data
  a. Generate all possible states (domain) for a row
3. Implement method for eliminating invalid states from the domain
